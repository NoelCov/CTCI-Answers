# Hey everyone!

<b>This is a repo that I'm using to store all my answers to the problems that the book "Cracking the Coding Interview" has.</b> I'm doing this to:

1) Record my progress
2) Help anyone struggling with the algorithms. You can check my answer and try to understand it. If you have any problems you can [message me directly]((https://www.noelcodes.dev/contact)) and I'll help if I have time.
3) To come back to them in the future for my own sake.

---
### I'll be happy to accept any sugesstions, or new/different answers to the algorithms. Just let me know so I can give you permissions.
